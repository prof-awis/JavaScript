# Guess My Number Game

This will be the first real project I will be working on with JavaScript.

It involves mainly DOM manipulation.

Follow through to see how it works

It will be a game that you guess a number that compares it to a secret number between 1 and 20.

If they equal then you win and it sets your high score.
